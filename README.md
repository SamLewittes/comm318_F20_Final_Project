## My final project for COMM318 _Stories from Data_ (Fall2020)

### Fantasy Football Predictions

* How well do experts and fans do at predicting the success of NFL athletes in fantasy football?

----

* Millions of Americans take part in fantasy football each year to win money, pride, or just for fun. Fantasy football is a very data driven with fans and experts forecasting who they think will be the best that year. Based on data from 2015 - 2019, I am analyzing how well these players did at predicting success based on pre-season rankings. 

* I am seperating the predictions by position as it will more accurately show the rankings. Specifically, the top 25 Quarterbacks, Running Backs, Wide Recievers, and Tight Ends are being compared by final points versus projected points.

* Ultimately, this analysis will show whether you should trust the experts, the fans, or if neither are particularly useful.
